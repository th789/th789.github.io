    synopsis: How do we evaluate and improve the safety of large language models (LLMs) for medicine? In this paper, we find that 1) current medical LLMs do not meet standards of general or medical safety and that 2) fine-tuning medical LLMs on safety demonstrations significantly improves their safety. Along the way, we present a definition of medical safety for LLMs and develop a benchmark dataset to evaluate and train for medical safety in LLMs.

    synopsis: How do we efficiently characterize a data point's vulnerability to noise using average-case robustness? In this paper, we 1) derive efficient analytical estimators, 2) validate their accuracy and efficiency through theoretical and empirical analyses, and 3) demonstrate their usefulness for various tasks involving average-case robustness (e.g., measuring class-level robustness bias and identifying dataset samples that are vulnerable to noise perturbation).

    synopsis: What factors affect laypeople and domain experts' trust in post hoc explanations? In this paper, we find that while laypeople base their trust on explanation faithfulness, domain experts (incorrectly) base theirs on explanation alignment, suggesting a cognitive bias among domain experts.

    synopsis: What are the basic properties of post hoc explanation methods and when is each method effective? In this paper, we 1) formalize the local function approximation framework, unifying eight diverse, popular explanation methods; 2) demonstrate that no method can perform optimally in every situation via the no free lunch theorem, calling for a principled approach to selecting among methods; and 3) set forth a guiding principle based on faithful function approximation to guide the selection among existing explanation methods and the design of novel ones.

    synopsis: To what extent do explanations from post hoc explanation methods agree and how are disagreeing explanations resolved in practice? In this paper, we introduce and systematically study the “disagreement problem” in explainable machine learning. We find that 1) existing explanation methods often generate disagreeing explanations and 2) practitioners do not have a principled approach to selecting among disagreeing explanations, resorting to ad hoc heuristics such as personal preference.

    synopsis: How do we effectively integrate and visualize high-dimensional, multimodal, spatial data in single-cell genomics? In this paper, to enable these visualizations, we develop Vitessce (Visual integration tool for exploration of spatial single cell experiments), a web-based, interactive visualization tool. We also develop associated Python, R/RStudio, and RShiny tools to enable using Vitessce within the Python and R bioinformatics ecosystems.

    synopsis: What is the genomic landscape of multiple myeloma and what are the genomic markers associated long-term survival? In this paper, we characterize the genomic landscape of multiple myeloma using deep whole-genome sequencing data. We find mutational signatures that reveal mechanisms of progression and variability in mutational load among known subgroups. In addition, we identify a new, genomically-defined subgroup (characterized by lower mutational load, age-related mutations, and the NRAS mutation) with prolonged overall and progression-free survival.

    synopsis: What is the role of miRNAs in the prognosis and progression of multiple myeloma? Here, we find that dysregulated miRNAs are predictive of disease prognosis in newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma patients and may contribute to disease progression by targeting key multiple myeloma genes (including MAF, BCL2, 14-3-3 and MYEOV).

    synopsis: At the genomic level, what distinguishes low-risk (long-survival) multiple myeloma patients from high-risk (short-survival) multiple myeloma patients? Here, we analyze whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing data from multiple myeloma patients and identify a new low-risk subgroup in which chromosome and telomere maintenance pathways and genes associated with low bone disease are upregulated, processes associated with DNA damage are downregulated, and there are lower mutation rates for known oncogenes and tumor suppressors (e.g. TP53, CSMD1, and FAT3/FAT4).
