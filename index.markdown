I am a PhD candidate at Harvard University working on trustworthy machine learning for medicine, advised by [Prof. Hima Lakkaraju](https://himalakkaraju.github.io/). I completed my undergraduate degree in Statistics and Molecular and Cellular Biology at Harvard University. 

My research interests include interpretable and robust machine learning, uncertainty quantification, causal inference, and their applications to medicine.
